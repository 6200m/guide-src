!!! danger "Beware!"
	
	A lot of the Disconnect24 Guide involves making modifications to your Wii system! These modifications may cause your Wii to become corrupt and "brick" if done incorrectly.
	Do not attempt this on a Wii U or Dolphin Emulator as Disconnect24 is not supporting these platforms yet. Make sure your Wii System Menu version is 4.3 before performing any guides on this site! **Disconnect24 does not take responsibility from the damage caused by use of these guides. Continue at your own risk!**

## Exploiting the Wii.

!!! abstract
	In order to use any Disconnect24 services, you will need to exploit your Wii and install the Homebrew Channel as that is the only way to make any modifications necessary to Disconnect24 work.

You will need:

* An internet connection.
> Required to use Wii Mail and patch your Wii Mail properly.

* An SD/SDHC Card with a capacity of 512MB or more.
> For the best results, try to use a 4GB SD card.

* A Wii with System Menu 4.3.
> You can check the System Menu Version by going into the settings menu on the Wii.

!!! tip
	Letterbomb is currently the most popular way to exploit your Wii. It is more stable and does not require additional channels unlike Flashhax and other exploits available at this time.

1. Visit the [Letterbomb Site](https://please.hackmii.com).
2. Select the System Menu Version that your Wii has.
3. Insert the MAC Address found in your Wii's settings and make sure that "Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!" is checked.
> You can cut any wire. No matter which one you choose, you will receive the exploit needed for your Wii.
4. Once you download the file, extract it to the root of your SD card.
5. Insert the SD Card into your Wii and enter the Mail board on the System Menu. You will find a letter with a bomb in it. Open that letter.
> You may or may not need to go back or forward a day on you board to find the letter.
6. The HackMii Installer will load in which you should install BootMii as boot2 (if possible) or IOS.
7. Install The Homebrew Channel.
8. Quit the installer.

## Wii Mail.

!!! abstract
	Wii Mail was a WiiConnect24 powered service for the Wii where you could send mail to another Wii or email address. This service has since been discontinued by Nintendo.

You will need:

* A WAD Manager.

* RiiConnect24 Patcher

* Disconnect24 Channel

!!! note
	The IOS WADs patch the RSA Keys and Wii Mail and thus, is needed for Wii Mail. We plan to make a cross-platform patcher soon as Batch isn't everyone's cup of tea. Disconnect24 shares no relationship with RiiConnect24 whatsoever.
	
1. Download the [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases/download/v1.0.5/RiiConnect24Patcher.bat) and download the patched IOS31 and IOS38 WAD files through it.
2. Copy the IOS WADs to your SD card and install them through the WAD Manager on your Wii.
3. Download the [Official Channel](https://github.com/Disconnect24/dc24-channel/releases) to patch your Wii Mail. Place it in the apps folder and run it through the Wii.

!!! success "Wii Mail should be installed successfully."
